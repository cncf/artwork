### Pre-submission checklist:

_If you're adding a new project to the repo, please confirm each of these actions has been completed:_

- [ ] Artwork is supplied in both PNG and SVG formats.
- [ ] SVGs are real vector-based files. Test and optimize them at https://autocrop.cncf.io before submitting.
- [ ] Artwork includes 3 layouts: horizontal (landscape), stacked, and icon.
- [ ] At least 3 versions of the artwork are provided: color, black, and white.
- [ ] Files follow the existing repo folder and naming conventions.
- [ ] The correct examples/file.md is updated with a section for the logos added, in A-Z order.
- [ ] A link to the new logo section is added to the main README.md, in A-Z order.

_Note_: Updates to this repo require two approvals to be merged in. One from a CNCF staff member, and the other from a project maintainer whose project's artwork is being updated. We can bypass branch protections for PRs made by maintainers.
